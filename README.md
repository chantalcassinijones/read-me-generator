Eleventh Challenge for Bootcamp in web-developing and UX

## Description

 In this challenge, I had to create a comman-line README.md file generator, which met the following requirements: 

Create a command-line application that accepts user input.
When a user is prompted for information about the application repository then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:
The title of my project
Sections entitled:
Description
Table of Contents
Installation
Usage
License
Contributing
Tests
Questions
When a user enters the project title then it is displayed as the title of the README
When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
When a user enters their GitHub username then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile
When a user enters their email address then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions
When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents then they are taken to the corresponding section of the README

This challenge was really fun. It was great to use the command-line and to give arrow functions and async/await syntax a go.  

## Installation

The README generator requires installation of Node.js and Inquirer npm must also be installed. Users must also have access to Visual Studio Code or equivalent or access to command Line Interface to run Node. 


## Usage

To use the README generator run: "Node index.js" in the terminal, and answer the prompts. After the prompts are answered, open the new README.md created in the current working directory, and preview the README.
